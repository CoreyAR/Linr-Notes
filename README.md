## [Linr Notes](http://www.linrnotes.com)

Linr Notes is a web app that retrieves liner notes for searched albums and recordings. The purpose of the app is to create a resource that allows for deeper exploration of the people behind music. The idea spurred from multiple conversations in Nashville about how the switch from a physical format to a digital format has resulted in the loss of a lot of metadata, including but not limited to liner notes. 

### Current implentation
This project is still under development. Musicbrainz is currently the only source used to pull information about searches but more sources will likely be implemented in the future.
