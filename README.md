## Linr Notes

Linr Notes is a web app that retrieves liner notes for searched albums and songs. The purpose of the app is to create a resource that allows for deeper exploration of the people behind music. The idea spurred from multiple conversations in Nashville about how the switch from a physical format to a digital format has resulted in the loss of a lot of metadata, including but not limited to linter notes. 

### Current implentation
This project is still under development. Musicbrainz is currently the only source used to pull information about searches but more sources will likely be implemented in the future. 

The current version requires an artist search that returns one result e.g. 'Greenday'. Please feel free to bug searches that result in errors so I can handle them appropriately. 

Thanks,
